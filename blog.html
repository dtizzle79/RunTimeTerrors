    <h2 id="lookatmysignature">Look at My Signature!</h2>
    <article>One time, a customer misspelled my name on an order they was giving me via email, even though it was plastered all over the previous email I had sent them. That fried me, so what I do? I misspelled their name on the confirmation 2 different ways. They've been spelling my name correctly ever since. #PettyDiaries</article>
    <h2 id="badcustomerservice">Bad Customer Service</h2>
    <article>I work in customer service, so I deal with customers all day. Some cool, some annoying, mostly annoying but anyway... I have this one particular customer that's got to be 90+, and he must not trust voice messages because no matter how long I'm on the phone with another customer he'll continue to hold. This despite my great turnaround time on returning calls. Well late yesterday was one of those situations. It's 4:20 ish, I get a call from a customer. I'm slightly irritated because I leave at 4:30. So I'm trying to hurry up and get this dude off the phone so I can get out of here on time. Well while I'm on the phone with this customer, the 90+ year old customer calls. He doesn't want to be helped by any of the other available people because apparently I'm the only smart person in my dept, so he asks if he can hold. Since I'm already on the phone, the receptionist puts him on my backline which means as soon as I hang up the phone his calls come thru right after. We never know this until it happens. After 7 minutes I'm finally able to get this other customer off the phone and as soon as I hang up the phone, the 90 year old dude's call comes thru. I am livid because now it's 4:27, I leave at 4:30, and this dude talks his head off and can barely hear due to oldness. When I see it's him holding, I immediately bark at the receptionist asking her why she put him thru knowing I leave in a few minutes. She responds in a whiny voice "well what was I supposed to do?" So the phones ringing and I still haven't picked up, then suddenly it stops ringing. I'm thinking he must‚Äôve got tired of holding, so I start logging off of everything as fast as humanly possible. When I went to close my phone portal I noticed that I was logged off. Not sure how cause I wasn't on it, but just to make sure everything was working properly I logged back in. As soon as I did that the phone started ringing again. The customer never hung up, but when you log off the portal it stops the phone from ringing. The customer doesn't know any of this. By the time I discover this deceitful magic it's 4:29...and the phones still ringing. What do you think I did with a whole minute left? Yep, you guessed it! I logged that mug right back off, grabbed my keys, and got out of there ASAP. The receptionist amusingly asked me what I was going to do about my customer and I replied "that is not my problem" and bounced. I spoke to that customer earlier today and he told me he held on the line for about 20 minutes then gave up on me. I acted like I never knew. #PettyDiaries</article>
    <h2 id="theworst">I'm The Worst Human</h2>
    <article>When I went to Sabin, there was a kid that lived right down the street from me that I was good friends with. He had some older sisters that my brother was trying to talk to, so we hung out quite a bit. About the middle of 5th grade, I moved, we went to different middle schools, and fell out of touch. 7 years goes by...I'm thriving at Madison, only going to school half days because I had completed most of my credits, I was driving, and I was slowly morphing into the guy you all know today as Petty. 
      Then one day, I'm walking down the center of the hallway with some of my friends when I noticed a scrawny, dopey looking kid walking towards us, but he was walking really close to the lockers, almost as to not be seen, but I caught a glimpse of his face and recognized him right away. It was the same dude I was friends with at Sabin. He transferred there to finish out his senior year. 
      Now if you're still reading this, you're probably thinking..awww, that's cute, he got reunited with his friend from Low school. That's really dope, and if you're thinking that, you must be new here. üòÇüòÇ
      I walked smooth past that boy and didn't say a word. He didn't see me tho so no big deal, right? Wrong. I saw him several times after that and still never spoke, but he never noticed. He always walked alone and with his head down. 
      Then one day, I was walking in the hall talking to the homies, and for whatever reason he decides to lift his head up. Then he looks at me, then he tilts his head,  I can tell he's putting it all together, and when he does he yells out "Derrick!" Now the homies I was talking to had went a separate way so I was by myself when this happens. What do you think I did? Yup, you guessed it. I looked at him confused, shook my head, said no and walked straight to my class. 
      See this dude was of the appearance of somebody that I didn‚Äôt want to be associated with. Even tho I knew that he would eventually find out when the yearbooks came out , but I didn't care because I knew that I was headed to Grambling that summer and would never see him again. 
      I am not proud of this particular story, but it did happen, so I‚Äôm sharing it. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

    <h2 id="mysoap">My. Soap.</h2>
    <article>About 87.384729% of the time that my boys use the restroom they use the one in my bedroom. 100% of that time they use my sink to wash their hands. That means my hand soap is used roughly 3 times as much as Keela‚Äôs. At that rate my hand soap is used up pretty quickly, right? Right. Now what‚Äôs a guy to do to help slow down the rapid use of my hand soap? You guessed correctly, I now use Keela‚Äôs hand soap. #PettyDiaries #QuarantineEdition</article>
